Current:

- Transform cells into a list to be the basis for all other operations

TODO:

- Implement data transformation functions
- Define data structures for storing parsed data
- Implement data transformation functions
- Add error handling and logging
- Test the converter with sample input files
- Refactor and optimize the code
- Document the usage and functionality of the converter



# start at cell level (every cell is an object). This will be tha basis for all other operations.

## For baronies, divide the cells into groups based on their aszgaar province
- Make sure here to handle burgs not belonging to a province
- Use state if nessessary and invent a new province for them
- Skip cells that are in the wasteland province (0).

# Next, make sure we can draw each of the baronies to the map using the "provinces interface" (Provinces here being the XK3 term for baronies, major rivers, wasteland and water zones).

proof of concept: Send list of "provinces" to the rawing function and output accurate map.


DONE
- Implement file parsing logic (Get data from the input files)
